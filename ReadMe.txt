# Rule-Based Chatbot

This is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python. It uses predefined rules and keyword matching to generate responses for user inputs. This approach is ideal for handling FAQs, guided conversations, or scenarios with limited and predictable user input.

## Features

- Keyword-based intent recognition
- Pattern matching with `re` (regular expressions)
- Predefined responses based on user input
- Extensible rule set for adding new responses
